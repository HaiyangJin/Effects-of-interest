  abstract = {A hallmark of face specificity is holistic processing. It is typically measured by various paradigms such as the part-whole and composite tasks. However, these tasks do not seem to test the same construct, so a comprehensive account of holistic processing remains elusive. Here we investigated the nature of facilitation and interference observed in congruent and incongruent trials in the complete composite face task. These two aspects are asymmetrically influenced by the location and cueing probabilities of the target facial half, demonstrating that there are at least two sources of influence contributing independently to holistic face processing: facilitation and interference. In our view, other tasks, such as the part-whole and standard composite face task, likely reveal facilitation and interference respectively as well. We propose that this perspective provides the opportunity to bring the mixed findings from different paradigms measuring holistic processing into one unified framework.},
